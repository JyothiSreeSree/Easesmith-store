Approach:

This project was built using React with styled-components for styling. It includes features like a product listing, pagination, and cart management using the useContext hook. I ensured the UI is responsive, added product cards with options for quantity selection, and a clean navigation structure for users to explore different products.
Challenges:

Implementing smooth state management across components.
Adding pagination for easy navigation through products.
Ensuring the UI remains responsive across all devices.
